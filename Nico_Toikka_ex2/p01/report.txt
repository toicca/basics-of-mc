Compilation:
gfortran mod_qcg.f95

Executing:
a.exe or a.out

Results:
m is chosen to be 11, since it's a prime number with itself being the only factor and from the same condition we get that a=11.
b is solved from the congruence b=k*13+1 with k=0
c can be in this case any prime number, so 3 should do it.

QCG gives the expected repeat interval of m=11
