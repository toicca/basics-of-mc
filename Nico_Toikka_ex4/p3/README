Compile:
$ gfortran -c mt19937-64.f95
$ gfortran -c sand_pile.f90
$ gfortran mt19937-64.o sand_pile.o -o sand_pile

Execute:
$ ./sand_pile L Ngrains seed

L is the maximum width of the pile
Ngrains is the number of sand grains to be dropped into the pile; must be at least 100
seed is the random number seed

Example:
$ ./sandpile 10 100 1234
Starting simulation with L=10, Ngrains=100, seed=1234

The program writes files:
- statistics.dat
    - Contains columns
        grain   ntopple      hsum      hmax
    - grain is the number of grains dropped this far
    - ntopple is the size of the toppling event after tha latest grain; how many grains toppled
    - hsum is the total amount of grains left in the system (the grains will overflow at the edges)
    - hmax is the current height of the pile  
- sand_pile.dat
    - Contains 100 frames of sand pile profile
    - The first L lines are the profile at step L/100,
      the second L lines are the profile at step 2*L/100,
      ...
      the last L lines are the final profile of the pile

The statistics.dat and sand_pile.dat files in this folder are example output from command
$ ./sandpile 10 100 1234
