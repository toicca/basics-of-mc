Results:
 - From plotting the RMS as a function of E_max, proper value for E_max was found out to be around 0.05, but no notable difference was found. Values nearest to 0
   are assumed to be unreliable.
 - RMS seems to grow with number of points and evens out at , which is curious, since it would be intuitive to think that accuracy would increase with tries.
 - There was some funky stuff going on with the code, so these results are definitely questionable.
 - N_points 10^8 was left out due to time limits.
