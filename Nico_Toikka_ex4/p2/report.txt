Compile:
$ gfortran -c mt_mod.f95
$ gfortran -c ex4p2_dist1.f95
$ gfortran -c ex4p2_dist2.f95
 - For 1st distribution
$ gfortran mt_mod.o ex4p2_dist1.o
 - For 2nd distribution
$ gfortran mt_mod.o ex4p2_dist2.o 

Execute:
 - Generating data:
$ ./a.out
or for Windows
$ a.exe

 - Generating figures:
$ python analysis.py

Results:
 - Example synthetic datasets are in distrs1.jpeg and distrs2.jpeg and cumulative functions of the means are in distr1_H.jpeg and distr2_H.jpeg.
   distr_h.jpeg also includes distribution of the means for fig. 1 and distr2.jpeg includes dataset used for fig. 2

 - Fig. 1:
 Lower and upper uncertainty respectively:
  -31.622947862168530        94.622947862168530
 Error assuming Gaussian shape:
   104.08807704866204

 - Fig. 2:
 Lower and upper uncertainty respectively:
  0.26192271545051415        8.8077338193666144E-002
 Error assuming Gaussian shape:
  0.49456678050050024

 - Comments on errors:
 There is a notable difference in the distribution errors and Gaussian errors with fig. 1 lower being 1/3 of the Gaussian and fig. 2 lower being 1/2 of the Gaussian.
 It should be noted that upper uncertainty for fig. 2 isn't correct, due to low number of bins (program couldn't find a bin for the value 0.85). A better representation of
 the errors is included in the cumulative plots.
