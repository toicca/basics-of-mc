Answer:
a) The LCG and Park-Miller are in mc_randoms.f95 and the Mersenne Twister is in mt19937-64.f95 (module is renamed mt_mod). 
LCG's parameters along with given m are a=10671541 and c=3, where a is chosen so that a-1 is divisible with all the prime factors of m and it's divisible with 4,
c is chosen as a prime number that's not a factor of m.

b) LCG's repeat interval matches the theoretical value for a LCG with c=/=0 (repeat interval=m) and the Park-Miller also gives the theoretical value (m-1).
Mersenne twister's repeat interval's value takes very long to calculate, but it should match the theoretical value 2^19937 âˆ’ 1.
Repeat interval analysis is based on the given information that LCG's do not return the same value twice within the interval.
