Points and distribution:
- The Park-Miller and the Mersenne twister seem to give good distributions with OK values.
LCG's distribution seem's terrible. Although it gives the theoretical repeat interval, it's values are extremely close to each other.

- LCG's points in given region are problematic with both seeds. 
The Mersenne twister has a small notch in values with first seed, but it's fixed with another seed and I expect that it goes away with higher number of numbers..
The Park-Miller doesn't seem to have problems.

Buffon:
- The error for LCG's needles at 10^4 is around 0.84. This is notably higher than the error in problem 2, which was aroung 0.1 with 10^4 needles.
